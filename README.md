# SGFDH Day 5 -- Platforms and Infrastructure
Platforms, Publishing, Hosting

For our session today, we will explore published Digital Humanities projects in pairs and compare the features of various popular platforms. Please select a project from the list below:

## Omeka/Neatline
* [The Hereford Map](http://historiacartarum.org/john-mandeville-and-the-hereford-map-2/what-are-you/)

## Scalar
* [Performing Archive: Curtis + "the vanishing race"](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/performingarchive/index)

## Wordpress
* [Parthian Sources Online](http://parthiansources.com/)

## Carto
* [Mapping Islamophobia](http://mappingislamophobia.org/)
* [Communal Currents](https://communalcurrents.org/)

As you explore the projects, please keep the following guiding questions in mind:

* What kind of projects would be a good fit for the features of this platform?
* Can you identify the type(s) of data/metadata being used? 
* In how many ways is the data made available to others? For instance, how might a researcher download the data to use in a new project?
* If you imagine this project in the coming years (decades?), what might be problems that come up over time? Are there areas of concern for sustainability?
* Where would your project be hosted (and by whom?) if you used this platform? Who has ownership, control, rights?
* How "safe" is your data here? Does the platform allow you to protect your data in some fashion?
* Is it possible to truly restrict access? Or is it security by obscurity?
